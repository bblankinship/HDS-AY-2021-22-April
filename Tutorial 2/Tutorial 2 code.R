# wrangle data for visualization ----

# code for the examples in the slides ----

## bar plot 
ggplot(data = cancelled, aes(x = Year, y = TotalCancelled)) + 
  geom_col()

### you can also pipe data into ggplot - note this creates the same plot as above
cancelled %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = TotalCancelled)) + 
  geom_col()

### you do not have to specify x = or y = either, this is the same plot as the 2 above - just different style of code
cancelled %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year, TotalCancelled)) + 
  geom_col()

## density plot 
ggplot(data = cancelled, aes(x = TotalCancelled)) + 
  geom_density()

## scatter plot 
ggplot(data = cancelled, aes(x = TotalCancelled, y = TotalOperations)) + 
  geom_point()

## inside and outside aes() 
### inside 
ggplot(data = cancelled, aes(x = TotalCancelled, y = TotalOperations, 
                             color = Year)) + 
  geom_point()

### if you try and specify the color to represent the 3rd variable Year outside the aes() you get an error 
ggplot(data = cancelled, aes(x = TotalCancelled, y = TotalOperations)) + 
  geom_point(color = Year)

### outside
ggplot(data = cancelled, aes(x = TotalCancelled, y = TotalOperations)) + 
  geom_point(color = "mediumpurple")

### similarly, if you try and put a single value and not a variable within the aes() R things you meant it as a variable 
ggplot(data = cancelled, aes(x = TotalCancelled, y = TotalOperations, 
                             color = "mediumpurple")) + 
  geom_point()

## both aes() inside and outside 
ggplot(data = cancelled, aes(x = TotalCancelled, y = TotalOperations, 
                             color = Year)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 4)

## layered example 
ggplot(cancelled, aes(TotalCancelled, TotalOperations)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_density2d()

### compare above to 
ggplot(cancelled, aes(TotalCancelled, TotalOperations)) + 
  geom_density2d() + 
  geom_point() 
  

# quick aside on tables ----
## more covered in Week 6 

head(cancelled) %>% 
  gt()

## to get you used to some of the code, check out the below table - change some of the code to figure out what different things do! 

#1st lets wrangle the data 
cancelled_table <- cancelled %>%
  #group the data 
  group_by(Year, HBName) %>% 
  # create summary variables 
  summarise(TotalOperationsYear = sum(TotalOperations),
            TotalCancelledYear = sum(TotalCancelled),
            PercentCancelled = (TotalCancelledYear/TotalOperationsYear)*100) %>%  
  # ungroup the data 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # filter the observations to include only those we are interested in 
  filter(Year %in% c(2020, 2021), 
        HBName %in% c("NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde", "NHS Lothian")) 


#then create the table   
cancelled_table %>%
  # select the variables we want included in the table 
  select(Year, HBName, TotalCancelledYear, TotalOperationsYear, PercentCancelled) %>% 
  # create a grouping in the table by heath board 
  group_by(HBName) %>% 
  # create the gt table object 
  gt() %>% 
  # format the percent column 
  fmt_percent(columns = PercentCancelled, decimals = 2, scale_value = FALSE) %>% 
  # create summary row in the table 
  summary_rows(groups = TRUE, columns = c(TotalCancelledYear, TotalOperationsYear, PercentCancelled), fns = list(Average = ~mean(., na.rm = TRUE))) %>%  
  # rename columns from what they are called in the data 
  cols_label(HBName = "Health Board",
             TotalCancelledYear = "Cancelled Operations",
             TotalOperationsYear = "Total Operations",
             PercentCancelled = "Percent Cancelled")
